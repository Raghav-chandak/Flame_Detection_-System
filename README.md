## Introduction
Fire hazards remain a significant concern in residential, commercial, and industrial 
environments, often resulting in severe damage and loss. Traditional fire detection and 
suppression systems are typically reactive and may suffer from delayed response times, 
thereby increasing the potential for fire escalation. To address these challenges, we have 
designed and implemented an automated flame detection and extinguishing system that 
provides an immediate and effective response to fire outbreaks. Our system comprises highly 
sensitive flame sensors, an Arduino Uno R3 for real-time data processing, and a motorized 
water dispensing unit. Upon detecting a flame, the sensors relay the information to the 
microcontroller, which processes the data and activates the motor to release water directly 
onto the flame. This rapid intervention is crucial in preventing the spread of fire and 
minimizing damage. By integrating cutting-edge sensing technologies with automated 
response systems, this project aims to significantly improve fire safety measures. The 
research contributes to the advancement of intelligent fire prevention systems, showcasing 
the potential for innovative solutions in enhancing safety and reducing fire-related risks.

## Connections
All the components mentioned above are connected in accordance with the block diagram as 
shown in the figure above. This section provides further details of the pin connections. 

Firstly, the liquid crystal display (LCD) has four connecting pins, namely the Ground, Vcc, 
SDA and SCL. The ground pin is connected to the ground in the breadboard and the Vcc is 
connected to 5 V input Vcc pin in the Arduino R3 board. The SDA pin reads the data and is 
connected to the A4 pin and the SCL pin acts as a clock and is connected to the A5 pin of 
Arduino Uno R3 board respectively. 

Then, the flame sensor has three pin connections: Ground, Vcc and Output. The Ground of 
the flame sensor is connected to the ground of the breadboard, the Vcc is connected to a 3V 
Vcc on the breadboard and the Output pin is connected to pin 4 of Arduino Uno R3 board. 
The 4V battery has a red (positive) and a black (negative) wire. The positive end is connected 
to the relay module whereas the negative wire is connected to the negative wire of the water 
motor. 

Furthermore, we have the water motor which consists of positive and negative wires as well. 
The positive is connected to the relay module, at the NO pin beside the common pin and NC 
pins whereas the negative is connected to the negative of the 9V battery. The positive of the 
9V battery is connected to the common pin of relay module. The servo motor consists of three 
pins that are represented by brown, red and yellow wires. The brown wire is Ground, the red 
is Voltage input and the yellow wire is connected to the pin number 5 in the digital pins of 
Arduino Uno R3. 

Overall, the connections shown in the above block diagram are explained in this section 
in detail.
